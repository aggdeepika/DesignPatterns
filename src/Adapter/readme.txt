The adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows two unrelated/uncommon interfaces to work together.
In other words, the adapter pattern makes two incompatible interfaces compatible without changing their existing code.


The adapter pattern is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
Adapter patterns use a single class (the adapter class) to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces/classes.
